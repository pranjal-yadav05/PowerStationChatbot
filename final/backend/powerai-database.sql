An incentive is \ngiven  for  higher  power  factor  and  a  penalty  is  imposed  for  lower  power  factor  by \nutility in billing of user. \n5.2 POWER FACTOR \nThe  majority  of  ac  electrical  machines  and  equipment  draw  from  the  supply  an \napparent  power  (kVA)  which  exceeds  the  required  useful  power  (kW).  This  is  due  to  the \nreactive power (kVAR) necessary for alternating magnetic field. \nThe ratio of useful power (kW) to apparent power (kVA) is termed the power factor \nof the load. The reactive power is indispensable and constitutes an additional demand on the \nsystem.  \nThe power factor indicates the portion of the current in the system performing useful \nwork.  A  power  factor  of  unity  (100  percent)  denotes  100  percent  utilisation  of  the  total \ncurrent  for  useful  work  whereas  a  power  factor  of  0.'),

The most important quality to be preserved is the di-electric \nstrength, which is affected by presence of moisture. \n \nThe  insulating  material  used  in  the  winding  are  hygroscopic  in  nature  and  therefore  moisture  is \nabsorbed through defective breathers, gasket and addition of untreated make up oil. It is essential to \nremove these impurities in purifying the oil when the di-electric strength goes below the permissible \nlimits. \n \nFor  purifying  the  transformer  oil,  machine  conforming  to  RDSO\'s  specification  no.ETI/PSI/103 \nmay be used. \n \nOil Sampling \n \nGeneral precautions \n  \n'),
